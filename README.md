sqlite DB manager w/sql.js

currently this is a prrof of concept showing how you can create a new DB on the file, drag your DB file out of the browser, or drag an existing one in. all 100% client-side

i would love to make this more of a 'webapp' where you can create, update and manage your sqlite files in your browser. maybe ill try angularjs and place it in the Chrome Web Store.
